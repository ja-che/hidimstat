Support recovery on fMRI data
=============================

This example compares several methods that estimate a decoder map support
with statistical guarantees. More precisely, we aim at thresholding the
weights of some estimated decoder maps according to the confidence we have
that they are nonzero. Here, we work with the Haxby dataset and we focus on
the 'face vs house' contrast. Thus, we consider the labeled activation maps
of a given subject and try produce a brain map that corresponds to the
discriminative pattern that makes the decoding of the two conditions.

In this example, we show that standard statistical methods (i.e., method
such as thresholding by permutation test the SVR or Ridge decoder or the
algorithm introduced by Gaonkar et al. [1]_) are not powerful when applied on
the uncompressed problem (i.e., the orignal problem in which the activation
maps are not reduced using compression techniques such as parcellation).
This is notably due to the high dimensionality (too many voxels) and
structure of the data (too much correlation between neighboring voxels).
We also present two methods that offer statistical guarantees but
with a (small) spatial tolerance on the shape of the support:
clustered desparsified lasso (CLuDL) combines clustering (parcellation)
and statistical inference ; ensemble of clustered desparsified lasso (EnCluDL)
adds a randomization step over the choice of clustering.

EnCluDL is powerful and does not depend on a unique clustering choice.
As shown in Chevalier et al. (2021) [2]_, for several tasks the estimated
support (predictive regions) looks relevant.

The `preprocess_haxby` function make the preprocessing of the Haxby dataset,
it outputs the preprocessed activation maps for the two conditions
'face' or 'house' (contained in `X`), the conditions (in `y`),

You may choose a subject in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. By default subject=2.

Making the inference with several algorithms

First, we try to recover the discriminative partern by computing
p-values from SVR decoder weights and a parametric approximation
of the distribution of these weights.

Now, let us run the algorithm introduced by Gaonkar et al. (c.f. References).
Since the estimator they derive is obtained by approximating the hard margin
SVM formulation, we referred to this method as "ada-SVR" which stands for
"Adaptive Permutation Threshold SVR". The function is ``ada_svr``.

Below, we run the ensemble clustered inference algorithm which adds a
randomization step over the clustered inference algorithm (c.f. References).
To make the example as short as possible we take `n_bootstraps=5`
which means that 5 different parcellations are considered and
then 5 statistical maps are produced and aggregated into one.
However you might benefit from clustering randomization taking
`n_bootstraps=25` or `n_bootstraps=100`, also we set `n_jobs=2`.

Plotting the results
--------------------
To allow a better visualization of the disciminative pattern we will plot
z-maps rather than p-value maps. Assuming Gaussian distribution of the
estimators we can recover a z-score from a p-value by using the
inverse survival function.

First, we set theoretical FWER target at 10%.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 200-204

.. code-block:: default


    n_samples, n_features = X.shape
    target_fwer = 0.1








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 205-208

We now translate the FWER target into a z-score target.
For the permutation test methods we do not need any additional correction
since the p-values are already adjusted for multiple testing.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 208-211

.. code-block:: default


    zscore_threshold_corr = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 212-215

Other methods need to be corrected. We consider the Bonferroni correction.
For methods that do not reduce the feature space, the correction
consists in dividing by the number of features.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-219

.. code-block:: default


    correction = 1. / n_features
    zscore_threshold_no_clust = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2) * correction)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 220-222

For methods that parcelates the brain into groups of voxels, the correction
consists in dividing by the number of parcels (or clusters).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 222-226

.. code-block:: default


    correction_clust = 1. / n_clusters
    zscore_threshold_clust = zscore_from_pval((target_fwer / 2) * correction_clust)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 227-231

Now, we can plot the thresholded z-score maps by translating the
p-value maps estimated previously into z-score maps and using the
suitable threshold. For a better readability, we make a small function
called `plot_map` that wraps all these steps.

Analysis of the results
-----------------------
As advocated in introduction, the methods that do not reduce the original
problem are not satisfying since they are too conservative.
Among those methods, the only one that makes discoveries is the one that
threshold the SVR decoder using a parametric approximation.
However this method has no statistical guarantees and we can see that some
isolated voxels are discovered, which seems quite spurious.
The discriminative pattern derived from the clustered inference algorithm
(CluDL) show that the method is less conservative.
However, some reasonable paterns are also included in this solution.
Finally, the solution provided by the ensemble clustered inference algorithm
(EnCluDL) seems realistic as we recover the visual cortex and do not make
spurious discoveries.
